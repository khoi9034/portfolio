        <h1>Geographic Access to Long-Term Care Facilities</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A spatial assessment of elderly population density and LTC facility locations in Tokyo — Khoi Nguyen, GEOG 446</p>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Japan faces rapid population aging. This study evaluates spatial alignment between ward-level elderly density (65+) and long-term care (LTC)
                facility locations in Tokyo. Using ward population data and geocoded facility points, I conducted choropleth mapping, overlay analysis, and
                accessibility evaluation (ward-level overlays and counts). Results show central and many suburban wards are well-served, while peripheral wards
                and specific wards (e.g., Ōshima and some outlying wards) reveal mismatches: high elderly density but limited LTC facilities. The analysis is
                automated via ArcPy workflows for reproducibility and policy-focused mapping.

    <!-- DATA & METHODS -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Data & Methods</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Population:</strong> Ward-level census data (Tokyo, 2020) — elderly counts (65+) and total population.</li>
            <li><strong>Facilities:</strong> LTC facility locations (municipal records + geocoding workflow via Google Sheets).</li>
            <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Datasets projected and cleaned in ArcGIS Pro; ward elderly density computed as (65+ / ward area km²).</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Choropleth mapping, overlay counts (facilities within wards), and simple accessibility checks (facility counts vs elderly density). ArcPy scripts automated joins, density calculation, polygon→raster conversion, and map exports.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- RESULTS -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Results (concise)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Choropleth maps show central wards concentrate both high total population and many elderly; some suburban wards have high elderly density as well.</li>
            <li>Overlay analysis indicates central wards (e.g., Shinjuku, Minato) are well-covered with LTC facilities; many peripheral wards are sparsely served.</li>
            <li>Notably, Ōshima (and a few other outlying wards/islands) displays relatively high elderly density but few or no LTC facilities despite infrastructure — a clear mismatch that suggests accessibility and equity concerns.</li>
            <li>Automated outputs (ArcPy) generate both maps and ward-level tables for planners to identify priority wards for service expansion.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- INTERPRETATION & IMPLICATIONS -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Interpretation & Policy Implications</h2>
        <p>
            The analysis suggests a layered geography: metropolitan cores have both high elderly counts and good facility coverage, while peripheral
            wards—including island or mountain areas—face accessibility problems. Areas like Ōshima demonstrate that physical infrastructure alone
            does not guarantee LTC provision. These gaps imply a need for targeted policy interventions (mobile services, transport subsidies, or facility investment)
            and for planners to incorporate elderly density, facility capacity, and travel-time/network measures into allocation decisions.

    <!-- LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Limitations & Future Research</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Current facility data are point locations without capacity (beds/staff) — capacity-weighted analyses would refine accessibility estimates.</li>
            <li>Population snapshots (2020) do not capture seasonal or commuter populations. Travel-time/network-based accessibility (transit times) should be added.</li>
            <li>Future work: integrate facility capacity, socioeconomic vulnerability, transport networks, and projections to create a composite LTC accessibility index.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reproducibility</h2>
        <p>
            All preprocessing and mapping were automated using ArcPy: projection, density computation, polygon→raster conversion, and map export.
            If you want, I can provide the ArcPy scripts and the geoprocessing workflow as downloadable files for the project page.
