        <p>
            I am currently a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, pursuing a 
            Bachelor of Arts in Geography with a minor in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), expected to graduate in May 2026. 
            My GPA is 2.9, reflecting the balance I maintained between a full course load, multiple part-time jobs, 
            and investing in personal growth through hands-on experience and the stock market.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about GIS, data analysis, and financial markets. I actively invest in individual stocks, including CrowdStrike and Oracle, 
            enjoy researching market trends, building portfolios, and learning the fundamentals of investing. 
            Beyond academics and investing, I enjoy anime, exploring new technologies, and continuously improving myself.
